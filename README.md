Developed for a social good datathon at the University of California, Berkeley. The project "An Exploration of the Association Between Political Affiliation and AQI Levels" investigates the potential relationship between political ideologies and air quality, with a focus on AQI components such as NO2 and SO2. It postulates that left-leaning countries exhibit lower AQI levels. The research employs Python for data analysis, along with visualization tools, to predict a nation's yearly AQI with 75% accuracy based on political orientation. This insightful study paves the way for impactful environmental policy development and public health improvements. Further investigations could involve regression analysis and examining the influence of various factors, such as environmental policies and population density, on AQI.
